2/12/23, 8:03 AM - +254 701 970415: *Question on INC Results*

*Wondering what to do having had Incomplete Results in a unit(s)?*

🔹INC means that certain marks are missing, either exam marks or course work marks.

▪If you did and submitted all the course work given by your respective unit lecturer, and also you're sure that you did and submitted your exam script, but find that you have Incomplete results, please reach out to your lecturer to inquire why you have INC.

▪If following up with the lecturer does not help, there are other ways of doing follow up like, filling in Results Complaints Form 9f your respective school, then doing a physical follow up with Examinations Office of your respective school.

▪You may be required to provide proof that you did and submitted all the course work given, in the event that Course work marks will be the ones missing.

🔹If there is any part of course work given that you did not do, then the INC result means you have missing course work marks.

▪Missing course work translates to a *RETAKE,* you have to take the unit again.

▪ *RETAKE* of a unit(s) is billed separately. Please visit Finance/Cashier's Office to be guided on this.

🔹In the case of INC for missing exam marks, you're supposed to sit for a Special Examination Paper for the affected unit.

Thank you.

A betting round occurs, followed by dealing 3 shared cards from the deck. As shared cards are dealt, more betting rounds occur, where each player can fold, check, or raise. At the end of a round, if more than one player is remaining, players' hands are compared, and the best hand wins the pot of all chips bet. Draw a class diagram for this system. Include relationships between classes (generalization and associational).

If you did whole coursework and exam and didn't manage to get 40+ that's a fail meaning you have to do special exam ndio uone kama uta pass ifike 40+

If you didn't do all coursework and did exam and get inc that's a retake

6/11/23, 3:44 PM - +254 701 360714: If you did whole coursework and never did exams that's inc meaning you have to do special exams.

6/11/23, 3:52 PM - +254 701 360714: If you are sure you did all coursework and exam it means there's an issue in either coursework or exam and now you have to lias with your lec

10/17/23, 2:17 PM - +254 731 914437: For android?
10/17/23, 2:17 PM - jeff: Yes
10/17/23, 2:19 PM - +254 731 914437: Little to no chance it works...but to make it try you have to 
1. Select the oldest version of android possible (max 5.1)
2. Switch to software emulation rather than hardware emulation
3. Pray
10/17/23, 2:21 PM - jeff: Tuma link ya hiyo old versin
10/17/23, 2:22 PM - +254 731 914437: What i mean is when choosing choosing SDK for your project select a lower version and for your AVD also select a lower version ...5.1 and below
10/17/23, 2:25 PM - Rep group A: What is the minimum requirements for it to run stably?
10/17/23, 2:27 PM - +254 731 914437: 8GB RAM will barely run it, but it will be decent since we wont be making very large apps in the unit...but 12GB ram and above is best
10/17/23, 2:27 PM - +254 704 776866: What matters is the ssd or hdd
10/17/23, 2:27 PM - Rep group A: Disk and processor?
10/17/23, 2:28 PM - +254 704 776866: And processor btw
10/17/23, 2:28 PM - +254 731 914437: CPU and RAM matter more, you can get away with an old HDD but  CPU and RAM will screw you
10/17/23, 2:29 PM - Rep group A: I think the praying point is very important and key!
10/17/23, 2:30 PM - +254 704 776866: Did U just say praying..😂😂😂😂

10/17/23, 2:31 PM - jeff: Right now, Android studio is very heavy. Utastruggle with those. The issue you're getting is coz you are trying to run android studio on a low spec machine. 

I was in a similar situation when learning to code. Saai, you have two options

1. Upgrade - it will be headache running android studio on 4gb ram and HDD storage. Get at least 8GB ram, and SSD like 125gb. Juma Allan talked of donating some laptops. You can talk to him akusaidie with upgrade (either a new laptop ama akusaidie purchasing those)

2. Move to web. I know you want to learn android, but web will be much more welcoming with low spec machine than android. Learn html, css and react. Either way, itakua a win. Within a year utakua unaeza make a simple website for someone akulipe, and you'll get a good laptop and either continue with web ama ukam Android.

That's my two cents
10/17/23, 2:31 PM - jeff: Got this from a senior dev

10/17/23, 2:32 PM - +254 731 914437: I have a PC with an old hard drive battered by FIFA , a core 1.5 cpu and 12GB RAM and the max android version I can run without going mad is 8.0..before I had 6GB of RAM and android studio simply Refused to run
10/17/23, 2:33 PM - jeff: Sasa 12 gb itafit kwa laptop kweli?
10/17/23, 2:33 PM - +254 704 776866: 2.6Ghz Quad

3/4/24, 6:44 PM - +254 758 685974: Just curious,why are people interested in Flutter to develop mobile apps while there are better technologies?
3/4/24, 6:48 PM - +254 745 474586: like ?
3/4/24, 6:49 PM - +254 745 474586: or rather e.g ?
3/4/24, 6:56 PM - +254 758 685974: There is Kotlin with Jetpack compose,Swift  with alamofire or react native with tamagui
3/4/24, 7:00 PM - +254 704 776866: Goooooooogle
3/4/24, 7:02 PM - +254 758 685974: all that I have mentioned are backed up by Google,Apple and Facebook respectively so I dont think that should be a reason enough
3/4/24, 7:03 PM - +254 745 474586: Kotlin 👀..you`re sure... Let me give my two humble opinion on this matter...Kotlin is for android only, swift Ios...You can`t code Swift unless you have a Mac Laptop, iphone app to test it on, or even opt to rent those services to test you`re app... React native by facebook is the only viable option left
3/4/24, 7:04 PM - +254 745 474586: But flutter has prettier UI components and widgets
3/4/24, 7:04 PM - +254 758 685974: Then why not react native coz its apis are way better
3/4/24, 7:04 PM - +254 704 776866: Mjenge group ingine..mnatushtua hapa 😂😂
3/4/24, 7:04 PM - +254 758 685974: This seems like a skill issue,designing which UIs looks good depends na the person
3/4/24, 7:05 PM - +254 745 474586: Same apis you`re using in other Js frameworks 😂
3/4/24, 7:08 PM - +254 745 474586: But if you`re good in Js, go the react native route...if C and java, choose flutter
3/4/24, 7:09 PM - +254 758 685974: No just easier ,I took time to go through both flutter and react native with expo and react native code just looks way straight forward,not because I know js but because it is.Lemme give an example
3/4/24, 7:10 PM - +254 745 474586: But do you know C , or Java...cause the syntax or rather structure i similar
3/4/24, 7:11 PM - +254 758 685974: <Media omitted>
3/4/24, 7:11 PM - +254 758 685974: <Media omitted>
3/4/24, 7:13 PM - +254 745 474586: ooh, i get your reasoning, react native has lesser code than flutter....
3/4/24, 7:14 PM - +254 758 685974: Yea i know both C and Java ,they are good languages but in real sense I dont think anyone given a choice to work with Python or Java would choose the complex Java or in this case the complex flutter
3/4/24, 7:15 PM - +254 758 685974: yea which means a nicer dev experience right?
3/4/24, 7:16 PM - +254 745 474586: I prefer Java for serious backend ...python for data science
3/4/24, 7:17 PM - +254 745 474586: heh...sophie`s choice <This message was edited>
3/4/24, 7:20 PM - +254 700 772176: I agree use flutter if you're making an app for ur mom or ur neighbor but if you're building a serious app really use anything else it's a very low entry framework with very low pay and very bad performance I've met people in Kisumu of all places who know flutter that's how easy and shitty it is
3/4/24, 7:23 PM - +254 758 685974: I have honestly found React Native to be way better for cross platform,good dev experience,supported and widely used by even facebook themselves,google is known for dumping projects and they already have android with jetpack compose,whats the use of flutter

3/4/24, 10:02 PM - +254 745 474586: but research confirms, that react native is indeed better...as one can build one`s own npm packages etc.
3/5/24, 10:35 AM - +254 731 914437: Is Anyone else missing marks which were previously there after the student portal came back online today? Several guys are reporting this, make sure to check

3/5/24, 11:01 AM - Sami: hii hukuwa independent.... I doubt
3/5/24, 11:02 AM - +254 742 280470: but a lot can happen before ikue backed up na depends if wanatumia their own servers ama cloud services
3/5/24, 11:02 AM - +254 758 685974: meaning
3/5/24, 11:02 AM - +254 795 864403: No it's not

3/5/24, 11:12 AM - +254 795 864403: The same guys who know what the languages they program ran in ... Failed to retrieve accurate data
3/5/24, 11:14 AM - +254 758 685974: To you it seems so,to them its a way of incremental testing where u make sure the system is online and healthy before beginning to feed it secure and huge data
3/5/24, 11:15 AM - +254 795 864403: So I think this is easy ... Meaning updation is still under way?
3/5/24, 11:15 AM - +254 758 685974: After I have explained right
3/5/24, 11:16 AM - +254 795 864403: After I gave a point of concern right ?

3/5/24, 11:18 AM - +254 700 772176: Ask him why it took him 2 months to copy paste a couple of results from a to b
3/5/24, 11:22 AM - +254 795 864403: Is sitting next to a data scientist enough to make you a member of the crew?
3/5/24, 11:22 AM - +254 758 685974: we talkin about data of over 25k students, and u hv no idea how much data u alone have from every token stored when u log in or out from ur virtual  campus to every time stored ukiingia iyo gate every day
3/5/24, 11:23 AM - +254 758 685974: Better than ranting from ur bed
3/5/24, 11:23 AM - Sami: backup haikuangi moja mzee kuna off-site, on-site....
3/5/24, 11:25 AM - +254 742 280470: ni different na every organisation na nani amekuambia back up haiezi fail?
3/5/24, 11:26 AM - Sami: don't you think they already know that?
3/5/24, 11:26 AM - +254 795 864403: Point blank...
3/5/24, 11:26 AM - +254 742 280470: who? what is your point?
3/5/24, 11:27 AM - +254 700 772176: Granted, but 2 months??? You can ship a car from Japan in less time I honestly think it's either incompetence or complacency
3/5/24, 11:27 AM - +254 795 864403: Who knows maybe it's a model of "i know of a guy" to cut on cost of expenditure
3/5/24, 11:27 AM - +254 111 714257: Much respect🤝... Kindly let us know when the whole incremental test is over so that we don't walk around yapping like education arts students, like we don't know what is going on
3/5/24, 11:29 AM - +254 758 685974: This is data,once u loose it its gone ,testing and preparation takes 80percent of the work actually, 20percent is the actually data transfer, look more into how big data works
3/5/24, 11:29 AM - +254 742 280470: session data na tokens should it be kwa db? like every time you login ?shouldn't it be destroyed on logout ama essence ya kustore za virtual campus
3/5/24, 11:30 AM - +254 795 864403: If I may ask .

 Despite having the data stored remotely... If incase backup fails completely... Will they start keying in data afresh ... And from what sources ... And would you please let us know what was the reason the system crashed ... Can it be a domestic attack ...or mismanagement by an intern <This message was edited>

4/6/24, 4:30 PM - +254 768 178786: fooling the educated,am not sure between the politician and the educated who's the fool,if the latter is,its a waste of school fees,why struggle learning if you can't think,at the end of the day we got farmers in Presidential positions and graduates here singing they need to learn more skills
4/6/24, 4:31 PM - +254 758 685974: prezo ni both educated na akona skill

4/6/24, 4:37 PM - +254 768 178786: In the process of learning you should actually be developing the skill, I presume and  that's my opinion,then what is going through a degree,masters and phd to end up having no job or anything relevant in respect to what you studied to earn you a living,unless you can not learn through normal system and jump straight into knowing a skill in which case you apply for a job and get it?

8/19/24, 9:59 AM - +254 794 625960: Hello everyone,
Hope you all good.

Yesterday at around 5pm a friend of mine received two messages. One from Equity bank and the other from M-PESA.
She had received 140,000 shillings. We thought it was some scam. I advised her to make a transaction of her M-PESA since she had some money in her M-PESA wallet. She sent 4,600 shillings to a friend. We checked the balance together and it was 144,000 shillings.
I told her to give it time the owner of the money will call. After about 30 minutes a man called. He sounded very rude. Below is the conversation with the man.
Man: Nimetuma pesa kwako kibahati mbaya.
Me: Umetuma pesa ngapi?
Man: Elfu mía moja arobaine.
Me: Umetuma na number gani?
Man: Sijatuma n'a number, nimetuma n'a equity bank.
Me: Majina za equity bank ni gani? Coz I wanted to confirm if he is the owner of the bank account.
Man: Wewe wacha kujifanya mjinga. Si wewe unaona hizo jina kwa simu yako? Fanya ivi, nitumie 138,000 kwa hii number then uchukue 2,000.
Me: Sitaki pesa zako. Na sikutumii pesa kwa M-PESA. Vile umetuma n'a bank. Pia mimi na rudisha na bank. Najua paybill ya equity ni 247247. Nipee account number yako nikudepostie pesa yako. But mimi sikutumii pesa yeyeto kwa MPESA.
Man: Kwani unadhani mimi ni mwizi? Mimi si mwizi. Wewe nitumie pesa KWA HII NUMBER.
Me: It's very simple call Equity customer care and request for a reversal your money is safe and if wanipigie i will immediately approve the reversal.
I hanged up the call.
I was much aware of the trick and i advised my friend not to utilize that money by any chance until it get's back to the account it came from.

What fraudsters are doing with this tactic is that they rob someone at gun point take their ATM which has the account number and force the victim to give their pin. After that, victim gets killed. Starts sending money to random people from the victims account then calls the number where the money is transfered to so that the money can be send to their anonymous numbers. After receiving the money they withdraw and dispose of that M-PESA line. You can't trace them. 

Then when the police try to trace that transaction, it will lead to you and not the perpetrator of the heinous act. Then you get arrested, detained and probably jailed after failing to prove that you are innocent. 

So guys, be careful. Usitumiwe pesa via bank then uambiwe utume kwa M-PESA ya msee. The money might be proceed of crime then unajipata kwa shida. Be super careful. Be Alert ,Emphasis on Current Crime Trends and Exercising Caution 24/7.
Good day.

1/21/25, 2:51 PM - Sami: Kindly wait, Chairperson SOT has requested. Due to the rise in enrolment for our physical sessions, a revised timetable will be made available, and we will be split up into more manageable groups.
1/21/25, 3:39 PM - Dan: No classes until then?
1/21/25, 3:54 PM - Sami: It would depend on the already given individual lectures if they would like to continue virtually, as the large number of students makes it impossible to do so physically.
1/22/25, 10:29 AM - Sami: <Media omitted>
1/22/25, 7:30 PM - Sami: Hello everyone, the lecturers for these units are listed below on the revised schedule: Fred Omondi will teach Advanced Application Programming, Kirema Mutembei will teach Data Science Programming, Maurice will teach Machine Learning, and Nderu will lead us through Embedded Systems. In the meantime, I've been able to get in touch with Nderu and Maurice. I'll keep you informed about the remaining units' respective groupings.
1/22/25, 7:34 PM - Sami: Tomorrow, we will conduct a PHYSICAL Machine Learning session for Maurice Odambatafwa. Since he also has another group, he wants to see us to see how many people he has and how he plans to continue.

For example, Fred Omondi's Advanced Application Programming class is listed twice on the schedule on Wednesday and Friday. Since group A has decided to have their session on Wednesday, ours should be on Friday. Just so you know, we have three BSD groups A, B, and "C." For this reason, three lecturers are allocated to the actual classes.

Since Fred has said that Ezekiel Kuria is the one who has been assigned to teach our class, and he(Kuria) will first contact the chairperson and Fred before responding to me.

According to him, we have been given a different lecturer, which I should check with the school. Given that the chairperson never answers, I'll need to visit there in person before getting back to you. You can attend the classes that are offered by other lecturers in the meantime.

2/6/25, 7:28 PM - Sami: Hello everyone,

Today, I had a meeting with the SoT chair, Gladys Mange, regarding several issues.

First, concerning the timetable, she mentioned that she has no control over it as it depends on the number of students enrolled. At times, they may not expect a large turnout, but students can surprise them by showing up in larger numbers.

Second, for those with missing marks, please follow this email format:

FROM: Your student email  
TO: The unit lecturer of the unit with missing marks (either exam or coursework)  
CC: SoT Exams Office, pkiarie@kcau.ac.ke, smwendia@kcau.ac.ke, g.mange@kcau.ac.ke  
SUBJECT: MISSING EXAM / COURSEWORK MARKS  

Hello, my name is [Your Name] and I am writing to inquire about my missing marks. Below are my details:  
Full name: [Your Full Name]  
Reg. No: [Your Registration Number]  
Unit Name: [Unit Name]  
Unit Code: [Unit Code]  
Trimester: [Trimester] 202x  
Mode: Full-time/Part-time/DL  
Exam Type: Supp, Special, or Ordinary  
Issue: Missing exam marks or coursework  
(Feel free to add any other relevant details.)

I look forward to hearing from you.  
Regards,  
[Your Name]

Please maintain a professional tone in your email. After sending it, wait at least 7 days for your issue to be addressed. If it is not resolved after that period, please reach out again. For those who have previously sent emails about missing marks in that format without receiving a response, contact me as well. 

Additionally, if you prefer to discuss your issue in person, please visit the exams coordinator’s office, Peter Kiarie, directly, rather than going to the SoT front desk. This will ensure you receive quicker assistance, as they share an office with the department chair.

Third, regarding the issue of lecturers not providing make-up opportunities for coursework missed due to fee-related issues, you are advised to write to the chair or department, Gladys Mange. Attach proof of your late fee payment along with the date of the administered coursework, the unit name, unit code, and the lecturer's name. This can help in resolving the matter.

For those who have complaints about project supervisors, please reach out to the projects coordinator, Joseph Kuria, and provide the lecturer's name and unit information.

Lastly, it appears that some students may not be fully aware of how to address their issues, and the faculty is not prepared to assist those who do not take action.

If anyone has additional concerns that I did not address, please feel free to reach out via DM.
